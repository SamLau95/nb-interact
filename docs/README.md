nbinteract
=================

nbinteract is a tool to convert Jupyter Notebooks to interactive webpages. It
allows notebooks that use [ipywidgets][] or [bqplot][] to be hosted online as
HTML pages for anyone to view and interact with.

This Gitbook contains documentation and examples of `nbinteract` usage. Use the
left sidebar or the right and left arrow keys to navigate the docs.
